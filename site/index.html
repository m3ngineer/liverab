                    <p>Rosa's love affair with yoga began about 9 years ago in cramped spaces and then with occasional classes in her local gym. She was fascinated by how grounded her yoga teacher was and how willingly she shared the tools to gain mental clarity through physical asana. This inspired Rosa to eventually pursue her teacher training- she wanted to learn more about the philosophy of yoga. Her biggest takeaway from her training was the strength of linking of breath with movement. This simple act taught her to come back down to the present moment, instead of focusing on the past or the future.
When Rosa became a certified yoga teacher, she saw how happy yoga made her students. It was inspiring (and still is) to see her students let go of fear and dive deeper into a pose or their practice.
For several years, Rosa owned a small yoga collective in the Hudson Valley (Pine Bush Yoga), where she used her business to not only teach yoga but to also fundraise for causes she believes in. She has since closed her business and have relocated to Connecticut, but Rosa continues to teach in local studios, festivals, corporate events, or more recently, in front of a computer screen through Zoom.
When she's not making corny jokes while teaching yoga, you can find Rosa in the gym, hiking, tending to her plants, or spending quality time with her family and friends, and my beloved cat, Milo.</p>

                    <p>Sharon Seuss has been teaching watercolor to “people who don’t paint” for many years. During the pandemic, she's been virtually teaching several groups and expanded into creative doodling. Sharon uses a simple step-by-step drawing technique that uses easy repetitive shapes to create different textures and designs, and puts you into a meditative state. And she's become addicted! It’s something you can do anywhere...while watching tv, riding in a car, on a napkin...  All you need is paper and pen, marker, or pencil and an open mind.</p>
<p>Sharon was a graphic designer for many years, and since retirement she's delved into the fine arts: acrylics, colored pencils, watercolor, creative doodling and writing. Sharon wrote and illustrated a children’s book, “The Mean Green Cleaning Machine” about a little girl who needs to clean her room. Sharon has 5 grandchildren and one great grandson and says they all need to clean their room! </p>
